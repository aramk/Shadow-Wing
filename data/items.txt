Item Data File
==============

This text file contains tabular data about each item in the game. You may
use this data in any way you wish in the source code of your program. It is
provided so that you don't have to work out the exact attributes and
placements of each item.

There are two sections. The "general item data" section contains a table with
a row for each item *type*. The "specific item data" section contains a table
with a row for each actual item instance. For example, there are several
Repair power-ups in the game -- the general table has one row for "Repair".
The specific table has a row for each Repair power-up featured in the game.
