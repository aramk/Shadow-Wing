I authorise the University of Melbourne to demonstrate this work publicly and distribute this work in binary form.

Here are my extensions:
- A full-fledged velocity system with acceleration, deceleration and everything in between for all objects. I have used
  mathematical functions for creating the easing in and out effect of acceleration. You give it the time you have been
  accelerating, and it will return the velocity.
- Missiles are pushed by your inertia if you shoot while moving, causing them to travel in your direction as they
  decelerate.
- All resources are loaded as deferred resources, so that we can show a pretty loading bar rather than a dead screen
  There is no duplicate replication of resources in any classes, everything is loaded at initiation and referenced
  by subsequent classes.
- A Menu class controls the different states of the game - paused, game over, or the game menu
  It also allows for full-screen and disabling sounds
- Game music is looping and objects have sound effects, which have slightly random pitches.
- I have a scoring system that gives points to the player when they collide/shoot to destroy objects. Different objects
  have different scores.
- The map can be traveled horizontally as well as vertically, so you can explore the whole width of the map now.
  As the player moves left and right, the camera shifts, revealing that side of the map.
- Any GameObject can have movement animations attached to it, like the player and fighter that have boosters and strafing animations.
- A new unit called a turret can shoot in any direction around it, but can not move. The direction and position of missiles is determined
  using the Unit Circle, so this eliminates the need to use a set 50px rule.
- If a player is being pushed off the map by a block, they can still try and escape by moving out of the way and accelerating
  upwards, as long as they can travel faster than the camera is causing the block to push down on them.
- Asteroids generate with a random rotation and direction, and rotate as they move.
- The boss has a health bar. I have instantiated from the same PanelBar class the player uses.
- If you're in DEBUG mode, pressing C can pause the camera, pressing G will enable no-clip.
- A pause and gameover screen for the game. A fullscreen mode. Frame rates are Vsynced and limited to reduce horrifying CPU overkill.
  Pauses the game when the screen loses focus.
- I have animations for objects in GameGraphic, and they can add as many animations to themselves as they like.
- I have changed the images for all objects.
- The stars in space move slower than the tiles on the map.
- When units are destroyed, they explode.
- I have added a Number class that draws any number you give it (using images, not font) anywhere on the screen
- I parse objects, the player, and checkpoints from a text file and add it to the world
- PanelBars can be extended and attached to any object, and monitor any property.
  They change colour, and colour schemes can be changed as well.
- The player has movement animations, so that it appears as if they are really turning.
- I have defined the space and left/right control keys to shoot for convenience.

- The Units are from Tyrian's free collection, the best darn shoot 'em up ever:

  I had to remaster every object though, bigger screens these days. Also, the boss is made entirely of spare parts.

  Since this not authorised for commercial use, you can remove it from the game folder if required and the game will
  simply play without music.
